The filesystem is formatted strangely because this was an assessed university project.

* If you came here to judge my code, go to "Assets/My Self-Created Assets/Scripts/"
* If you came here to judge my game design skills, import this project into Unity and try it out.

Please note that at some point a Unity upgrade altered the project and it no longer plays the way it was intended, specifically in regards to player movement and looking. This project was last edited using Unity 2020.3.30f1
